# Star Trek Annotated Episode Guide

This repository contains _Star Trek_ episode listings where each episode is "**tagged**" (annotated) with one or more descriptive _labels_ which summarize the major genre(s) of each episode.

The repository contains simple .html files. So in order to use these listings, just _clone_ the repository and then open _index.html_ in your browser.

Currently there's

- [Star Trek: Voyager](st-voyager.html) ([preview](https://raw.githack.com/isync/star-trek-annotated-episode-guide/master/st-voyager.html))
- [Star Trek: The Next Generation](st-the-next-generation.html) ([preview](https://raw.githack.com/isync/star-trek-annotated-episode-guide/master/st-the-next-generation.html))

The HTML files contain simple JS code which allows you to filter the listings according to tags. Try it!

The HTML is built from source spreadsheet files which are also included in this repo.

## Rationale

Over the years of being an avid Star Trek fan, I found out that I mostly enjoyed episodes which  revolve around or start out from a mystery element. When I decided to watch some selected episodes of the show again, I wanted to start with these - thus I needed to know which epsiodes the mystery ones were... That's why this guide here was compiled.
